## 🏛️ Executive Summary & Architectural Vision

The **Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA)** administers 5 active higher-education scholarship and fellowship programs to empower Scheduled Tribe (ST) students across schools, premier Indian universities, and top global institutions ([dbttribal.gov.in](https://dbttribal.gov.in/AllScheme.aspx)):

1. **Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme for ST Students**: Centrally sponsored secondary school assistance for regular ST scholars in Classes IX & X with family income ≤ ₹2.50 LPA (Day Scholar: ₹225/mo, Hosteller: ₹525/mo, Books Grant: ₹750/yr).
2. **Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme for ST Students**: Flagship Centrally Sponsored scheme covering higher secondary (Classes XI–XII), ITI, Polytechnic, Diploma, Undergraduate, and Postgraduate courses across 4 recognized course groups with family income ≤ ₹2.50 LPA (100% compulsory non-refundable fees + living allowance up to ₹1,200/mo).
3. **Top Class Education for ST Students**: 100% tuition coverage, ₹45,000 IT hardware grant, books allowance, and monthly living assistance in notified premier institutions (IITs, IIMs, NITs, AIIMS, NLUs, NIDs) for scholars with family income ≤ ₹6.00 LPA.
4. **National Fellowship for Scheduled Tribe Students (NFST)**: 750 annual research fellowships for regular M.Phil and Ph.D. scholars in Indian universities with family income ≤ ₹6.00 LPA (₹37,000–₹42,000/mo JRF/SRF stipend, HRA, and ₹20,500 annual contingency).
5. **National Overseas Scholarship (NOS)**: 100% actual tuition fee coverage, economy return airfare, and annual living allowance (GBP 9,900 / USD 15,400) for Master's and Ph.D. studies at **QS World Top 500** universities (priority to ranking ≤ 200) with family income ≤ ₹8.00 LPA.

### The Core Problem Addressed
* **Manual Scrutiny Delays**: Applications historically required 4 to 6 months of multi-tier verification across school/university, district, state, and ministry desks.
* **Repetitive Correspondence**: Minor document deficiencies (lapsed annual income certificates, smudged revenue seals) led to prolonged delays and accidental rejections.
* **Hardcoded Eligibility Engines**: Legacy portals could not accommodate annual quota modifications or affirmative action adjustments without code redeployments.
* **Post-Selection Bottlenecks**: Absence of automated tracking for supervisor-endorsed Quarterly Progress Reports (QPR) and timely Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) release through PFMS.

**VidyaSetu (विद्यासेतु)** bridges the existing government scholarship ecosystem (NSP, DigiLocker, PFMS, NPCI) through an intelligent orchestration layer to human scrutiny officers:  
**Discover ➔ Apply ➔ Verify ➔ Scrutinize ➔ Select ➔ Communicate ➔ Disburse ➔ Monitor**

> [!NOTE]
> **Prototype Architecture & Sandbox Grounding:**  
> VidyaSetu is a functional, modular prototype built for Smart India Hackathon 2026. External interfaces (UIDAI Aadhaar e-KYC, DigiLocker repository, PFMS e-FTO, and NPCI Aadhaar Payment Bridge) are implemented as **integration-ready sandbox adapters** that adhere to published government interface schemas. The AI document-intelligence engine is implemented as a simulated service architected to interface with production OCR solutions (e.g. Google Cloud Document AI, AWS Textract, or open-source Tesseract OCR). **AI assists, rules govern, humans decide**—all statutory and financial sanctions are strictly executed by authorized officers.

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Module 1: Document Intelligence & OCR Service (`documentAI.js`)
* Extracts document attributes: issuing authority, certificate serial number, date of issuance, candidate name phonetic similarity (98%+ match).
* Cross-references applicant community against the **Central Scheduled Tribe list notified under Article 342 of the Constitution of India**.
* Architected as a modular interface that integrates with production OCR engines (Google Document AI / Tesseract) while providing a reliable prototype sandbox.

### Module 2: Automated Deficiency & Cross-Application Anomaly Detection
* **Automated Deficiency Detection**: Detects lapsed certificates (e.g. an Income Certificate issued in Jan 2023, exceeding the statutory 1-fiscal-year validity window). Dispatches instant deficiency notices with a 15-day resolution window preserving queue seniority.
* **Cross-Application Anomaly Detection**: Uncovers shared contact numbers, bank accounts, or duplicate identity markers across different applications (e.g. flagging potential fraud rings across state borders).

### Module 3: Policy Simulator Decision Support System (`policySimulator.js`)
* Evaluates proposed policy rule adjustments (raising income ceilings, relaxing marks, adding affirmative PVTG quotas) across a calibrated demonstration pool of **10,000 Synthetic Applications**.
* Delivers instant predictive impact analysis: projected beneficiary deltas, fiscal budget impact (in ₹ Crores), and administrative scrutiny workload changes.

### Module 4: Multilingual Voice & Text Copilot — VidyaMitra (`VidyaMitraChatbot.jsx`)
* Conversational assistant supporting 6 languages: English, हिन्दी (Hindi), ওডodia (Odia), ᱥᱟᱱᱛᱟᱲᱤ (Santali - Ol Chiki script), తెలుగు (Telugu), and मराठी (Marathi).
* Equipped with Web Speech recognition and synthesis to assist first-generation tribal learners in discovering schemes and understanding eligibility.

## ⚖️ Deterministic Governance: "AI Assists, Rules Govern, Humans Decide"

To prevent algorithmic discrimination and ensure strict adherence to Indian administrative law:

1. **AI Assists**: AI extracts text, maps coordinates, identifies expired dates, and flags potential anomalies into triage queues (`READY`, `REVIEW`, `DEFICIENT`).
2. **Rules Govern**: Scheme eligibility is determined **100% deterministically** by statutory rules (`ruleEngine.js`) citing official MoTA guidelines and Article 342. No applicant is ever rejected by an AI probabilistic score.
3. **Humans Decide**: Sanction orders and adverse rejections are strictly executed by designated Ministry Officers on the **Dual-Pane Scrutiny Desk**, with mandatory statutory clause logging for RTI auditability.
